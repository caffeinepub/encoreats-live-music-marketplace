  "summary": "Diff implements role persistence via sessionStorage (set/get/clear), preselects role in Profile Setup with default musician, and clears stored role on logout/profile creation. LandingPage introduces role-aware login handler but the provided truncated snippet only clearly shows a single header CTA wired to the venue role; the presence of three distinct role buttons cannot be fully verified from the visible diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Landing page shows three role-specific login buttons (Venue, Musician, Customer), each initiating the existing Internet Identity login flow, with loading/disabled state, and English labels.",
      "reason": "In the visible LandingPage snippet, the sticky header shows only one CTA button ('Get Started') that calls handleRoleLogin('venue'). The truncated excerpt does not show the other two role buttons or their labels/states, so the AC cannot be confirmed from the provided diff evidence.",
