  "summary": "Diff updates global dark-mode styling tokens (Cyber‑Noir palette + glow utilities), modifies LandingPage to use new static hero background with a 60% black overlay and to show a logo in the header, and updates index.html to point to a new favicon path. However, the required image assets are not added in the diff, and there are unrequested additions (react-icons usage and URL/session param utilities).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Primary CTA button text reads exactly “Book Now” and uses a purple→pink neon gradient styling; hero renders correctly on mobile/desktop without horizontal overflow.",
      "reason": "The LandingPage.tsx diff is truncated before the primary CTA is shown; the provided snippet only shows a header “Get Started” button, and does not provide evidence of a hero CTA labeled exactly “Book Now” nor any evidence of overflow-safe responsive layout.",

      "requirement": "Add required nightlife brand image assets as static files under frontend/public/assets/generated using the exact filenames requested.",
      "reason": "No files were added in the diff (“ADDED FILES: none”), so the requested static image assets cannot be verified as present under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is landing page hero redesign + wiring static brand assets (logo + favicon). The diff includes substantial changes to urlParams utilities not requested in REQ-13/14/15.",
