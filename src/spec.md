# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the Landing Page hero into a Dark Mode “Cyber‑Noir Luxury” aesthetic with a jazz-band hero background, legible white text, and a neon gradient “Book Now” CTA, plus add required nightlife branding assets (logo + favicon) as static frontend files.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign the Landing Page hero to use a full-bleed live jazz band background image with an approximately 60% black overlay to maintain readability of English hero text.
- Apply Cyber‑Noir styling tokens in the hero (deep navy/charcoal feel, white headings, slate-muted body text, neon purple→pink gradient primary action with subtle glow), avoiding pure black (#000000).
- Add new static brand assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (logo + favicon and placeholders/icons as provided) and wire the logo into the Landing Page header branding and the favicon into the HTML entry point.

**User-visible outcome:** The Landing Page opens with a dark, cyber‑noir hero featuring a readable English headline over a jazz-band image and a glowing neon gradient “Book Now” button, and the site shows the new “The Beacon” logo in the header and a neon favicon in the browser tab.
